# Analysis for Geographic migration and vaccine-induced fitness changes of *Streptococcus pneumoniae*
The two folders pertain to the two main components of this paper. <br />
1) Geographic Analysis including human mobility model and relative risk framework:  ```./HumanMobility_RR/```
2) Fitness Model quantifying the relative fitness over time of serotypes individually, grouped by whether they are vaccine type or non-vaccine type, and penicillin susceptibility: ```./Fitness/```
